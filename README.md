# 🧠 C Programming Journey

Welcome to my C programming repository!  
This is where I document everything I learn from simple programs and logic i used to mini-projects and programs.

## 📚 What's Inside
- 💻 Practice programs with logic explanations  
- 🧩 Projects 
- 🧠 Advanced Concepts like pointers, structures, files, and memory management  

## 🎯 Goal
To build a strong foundation in C programming through consistent practice and documentation of my learning journey.

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add more structured projects  
- Explore data structures in C  
- Optimize and document code for beginners
